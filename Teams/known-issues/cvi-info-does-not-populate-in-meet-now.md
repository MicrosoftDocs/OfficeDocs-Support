# CVI information autopopulated in a Teams Meet Now instance does not work

## Summary

If your Cloud Video Interop (CVI) information populated in a Meet Now meeting in Microsoft Teams does not work please check your license with you CVI partner.

To meet right away using CVI coordinates, Microsoft Teams currently supports two scenarios: 
* click Meet Now in the Teams Calendar 
* click Meet Now in Outlook Calendar

These two scenarios will generate working CVI coordinates.
