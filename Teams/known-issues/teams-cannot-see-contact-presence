If a Teams user cannot see the presence of a contact in Teams, this can be due to:

1: The contact being offline i.e. not signed into Teams. 
2: The contact has set presence to "Appear offline" to indicate the contact has not signed in to Teams.
3: There is a network issue communicating with the unified presence service (UPS), you will need to ensure connectivity to the following endpoints - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges?view=o365-worldwide#skype-for-business-online-and-microsoft-teams
4: The contact could be using Skype for Business still and hence presence would be determined as described here - https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/coexistence-chat-calls-presence#presence
