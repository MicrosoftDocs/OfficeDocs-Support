Your self-presence is Teams seems stuck on away (yellow) instead of available (green). This can happen for following reasons:

1: Verify that you have no pending updates - Click on your picture in Teams and then "Check for updates"
2: The presence can be away by design if the machine has been inactive for more than 5 minutes.
3: It can take 2-3 minutes for the self-presence to be updated from inactive to active based on activity on the machine e.g. machine coming out of sleep mode, user moving the mouse, etc.

If none of the above address your concern, please open support ticket and provide the following information:
1: Sign-in addres of the user impacted
2: The Desktop and Web logs - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/log-files 
3: Approximate time in UTC when the presence was expected to be available and not away. Verify this time is captured in the logs collected above.
